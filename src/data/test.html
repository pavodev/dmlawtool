Thus, now, you need the subject’s consent in order to lawfully collect and process their personal data. <br />Before choosing whether you can anonymize data or not, it is important to clearly understand how to ask a consent, when a consent is valid, and what to do in particular cases (retroactive consent).&nbsp; </p> <p style="margin: 0cm"> <br />The most common solution is to obtain the data subject’s valid consent, but the law provides other exception. In the field of research, an important exception is the processing of personal data not related to a specific person for the purpose of research or statistics.&nbsp; </p> <p style="margin: 0cm">&nbsp;</p> <h3 style="margin: 0cm"> <strong ><em><u>Definitions needed to be able to make your choice:</u></em></strong > </h3> <div style="margin: 0cm"> <div className="ui divider"/> <h3 style="margin-top: 15px; font-size: 14px"> <strong ><em><span style="color: #4472c4">Legitimate ground</span></em></strong > </h3> </div> <p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify; "> <span>&nbsp;tbd&nbsp;</span> </p> <div style="margin: 0cm"> <div className="ui divider"/> <h3 style="margin-top: 15px; font-size: 14px"> <strong ><em><span style="color: #4472c4">Consent</span></em></strong ></h3></div><p style="margin-top: 5px; margin-right: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left: 0; text-align: justify"><span>A consent is a permission for something to happen or agreement to do something (Oxford Languages Dictionary). In a legal language, a consent is a particular type of legitimating motive. This motive let the other person do something that they shouldn’t do without it.&nbsp; The data processor must ask for the consent directly to the data subject, who must be capable of discernment in order to lawfully give their consent. If the subject doesn’t have a full capacity of discernment (which has to be specifically evaluated from case to case), the consent must be sought from the legal representative (the parents or the guardian). Consent is not needed for a deceased person.&nbsp; A particular form of the consent is not foreseen by the law.<br/><br/>However, a correct request for a consent must contain the following information:&nbsp; <ul> <li>the specific purpose of the data collection</li> <li>how the personal data will be processed, what will be done with the personal data</li> <li>if the personal data will be pseudonymized or anonymized and when</li> <li>how long are the personal data be kept for</li> <li>if the personal data will be given to third parties</li> <li> the processor’s contact, because the subject has the right to contact the processor anytime to ask anything concerning their personal data processing </li> </ul> The subject has the right to:&nbsp; <ul> <li>refuse the processing of their personal data</li> <li> anytime withdraw their consent until the moment data are anonymous. That means that if the subject requires their personal data to be erased, the processor must do so. </li> <li>Take an informed decision concerning giving or not giving their consent</li> </ul> The consent of the subject must be:&nbsp; <ul> <li>specific to the purpose asked for</li> <li>freely given: the subject must not endure negative consequences in case of refusal</li> <li>clear, unambiguous</li> <li> given by a clear affirmative action, whether the action is verbal or written.
